### Warbacon

I'm currently studying **computer engineering** at the *University of Cadiz*.
I love **Linux** and the **open source** community, although I'm also a fairly advanced Windows user too.

**Projects:**

- I'm actively maintaining [zunder-zsh](https://github.com/Warbacon/zunder-zsh).
- My [Neovim config](https://github.com/Warbacon/nvim-config) is fast, lightweight and works both in Linux and Windows.
- I have made Powershell [less horrible](https://github.com/Warbacon/powershell-profile).
- I have some experience with web development. Sometimes I make experimental applications.
