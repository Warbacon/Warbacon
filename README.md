# Hi there!

I'm currently studying **computer engineering** at the *University of Cadiz*.
I love **Linux** and the **open source** community.

- I'm maintaining [zunder-zsh](https://github.com/Warbacon/zunder-zsh).
- My [Neovim config](https://github.com/Warbacon/nvim-config) is based on
  [Lazyvim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) and is incredibly fast and light.
- I have some experience with web development. Sometimes I make experimental applications.
